# Error handling standard

Contract modules keep their Soroban `#[contracterror]` enums because those
numeric values are part of the public ABI. New and migrated errors also
implement `StandardContractError`, which supplies one consistent descriptor:

- `module`: a stable namespace; `(module, code)` is the unique error identity.
- `code`: the existing ABI-safe `u32` discriminant.
- `kind`: validation, authorization, not found, conflict, resource limit, or
  internal.
- `retryable`: whether an unchanged request may succeed if attempted later.

This creates a hierarchy that SDKs, logs, and user interfaces can consume
without renumbering deployed errors. Numeric codes only need to be unique
within a module. They must never be reused for a different meaning after
release.

## Adding an error

1. Add a documented variant to the module's `#[repr(u32)]` error enum.
2. Assign the next unused code in that enum; do not reorder or renumber old
   variants.
3. Add the variant to the module's `StandardContractError` match.
4. Classify caller mistakes as `Validation`, permission failures as
   `Authorization`, missing state as `NotFound`, state collisions as
   `Conflict`, bounded-capacity failures as `ResourceLimit`, and invariant or
   downstream failures as `Internal`.
5. Mark an error retryable only when time or transient capacity can resolve it.
6. Test its descriptor and the contract behavior that emits it.
7. Add the new code to the module's table in [ERROR_CODES.md](ERROR_CODES.md).

The access-control, analytics, and batch-processing modules are the reference
implementations. Other modules can migrate incrementally without ABI changes.
